# Building the Gadgetron-Starter Project

## Using a devcontainer for development

The repository has a `.devcontainer` configuration for use with the [VS Code Remote](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Open the Gadgetron-Starter folder in VS Code and make sure you have the [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed. The extension should prompt you to reopen in a devcontainer, which will have all the dependences and tools needed for Gadgetron development.
